        "description": "The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The name describes the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated 100â€“400 billion stars and at least that number of planets. It has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and a thickness of approximately 1,000 light-years. The central bulge of the Milky Way contains a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*.",

        "description": "The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.537 million light-years from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest galaxy in the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 54 other smaller galaxies. Andromeda is on a collision course with the Milky Way and is expected to merge with it in about 4.5 billion years, forming a new galaxy. Andromeda has a diameter of about 220,000 light-years and contains roughly one trillion stars.",

        "description": "The Large Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy and satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. At a distance of around 163,000 light-years the LMC is the second- or third-closest galaxy to the Milky Way, after the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal and the possible dwarf irregular galaxy called the Canis Major Overdensity. Based on the D25 isophote at the B-band, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 32,200 light-years across. It is roughly one-hundredth the mass of the Milky Way and is the fourth-largest galaxy in the Local Group, after the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, and the Triangulum Galaxy.",
